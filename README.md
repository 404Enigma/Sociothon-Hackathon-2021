<h2>Tagline</h2>
<p>Clinica is a web platform that can be used to provide generic medicines at a cheaper price to patients under the Government of India's Jan Aushadhi Scheme (JAS). It tackles the problem of a weak supply chain using artificial intelligence (AI) and bridges the poor distinction between the price of branded and generic medicines by building a specific platform for selling medicines.</p>

<h2>The Problem it Solves</h2>
<p>Clinica is a web platform that basically tackles two problems i.e. a weak supply chain and the poor distinction between the branded and generic medicines. 
</p><p>
To tackle the problem of a weak supply chain, Clinica uses a machine-learning algorithm which is used to predict the sales of the drugs for the current month by calling out a private API made by us which basically consists of a machine learning algorithm. 
</p><p>
So, the algorithm's main task is to identify the relationship between the sales of the drugs of previous years considering data back from 2014 to the present month in the field of pharmaceutical. After predicting the sales of the current month, it is used by the vendor to predict the amount of stock needed by him for that particular month. It then helps in building a strong supply chain system by directly keeping in contact with the supplier and the vendor.
</p><p>
Clinica also has a feature named "Emergency Need of Stock" which is available to the vendor in case of need of emergency stock. It can be used when there is a sudden increase in the demand for a particular drug which forces the supplier to increase the supply of that respective drug to avoid the sudden break in the supply chain system. Using Clinica, one can predict the sales of the future too using our API. By predicting the sales of the current month, our system surpasses the problem of the supply chain system.
</p><p>
Secondly, to tackle the problem of the poor distinction between the branded and the generic medicines, Clinica has a (separate) platform for its customers to know about what are generic medicines and how they are different from branded medicines in terms of price and quantity. A platform built to let know its customers about the generic medicines provided under the Government of India's Jan Aushadhi Scheme (JAS) and where a customer has a choice to add a particular medicine to its cart of future references. Our platform is a positive means to spread awareness of the ongoing Govt. scheme. People often don't know the variation of prices in the medicines, our platform shows the same before the eyes of the customer so that they can choose wisely and buy the much better deal.</p>

<h2>Challenges we Ran Into</h2>
<p>- Engaging in hackathons for the first time was little challenging for the whole team.
<br>
    - We had to brainstorm the problem statement and figure out the exact solution asked. We were anxious that whether we are heading in the right direction or not.
    <br>
    - We had to keep the pace of development so that the project was built in the given time frame.
    <br>
- We were unable to integrate effectively the machine learning algorithm with the NodeJS server. So, we overcame the issue faced by developing an API of the same.
